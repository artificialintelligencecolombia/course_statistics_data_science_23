==============================
BIAS
==============================

In the sampling process, the idea is to avoid the BIAS so the sampling can be 
completely random for the correct representation over the population.

---------------------
SAMPLING BIAS
---------------------

Its not an error, but a variation over the sampling than affects the population
metrics.

a. Sesgo de respuesta:
- Error with the measurement tool.
- Preguntas confusas, capciosas.
- Preguntas no respondidas.

b. Sesgo de infracobertura:
- Sample does not represent the population.
- We exclude samples from population.
- We pick the sample.

c. Sesgo de NO respuesta:
- The sampling is well perfomed, but much percentage does not answers to the
questions. So we have a lot of missing information.
