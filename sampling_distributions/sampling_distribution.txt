SAMPLING DISTRIBUTION OF A STATISTIC
==============================

- Sample statistic: Metric calculated from a sample from a larger population.
- Sampling distribution's onterested in how different samples are from each other.


Measure|Standard Deviation|Standard Error
Variability|Within a sample|Between samples
Width Definition|Distribution of individual values|Sampling distribution
Assessment|Data values and sample mean|Sample statistics and population parameter (i.e., accuracy)
Sample Size Effect|No tendency to change|A tendency to decrease

Standard errors evaluate the precision of a sampleâ€™s estimate. Smaller SEs
represent greater precision.
